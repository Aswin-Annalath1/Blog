1.// create Node environment (npm init --y)
2.// installing express (npm i express)
3.// Install TypeScript as a development dependency and also types for packages (npm install --save-dev typescript @types/express @types/node)

Now to use typescript we need to convert to javascript and then compile so for this we need to set configurations.
This is called Transpilation of code where all errors are found, then only code is allowed to run.

4.//Create a tsconfig.json file to configure TypeScript settings (npx tsc --init)
5.//Manually set path for typescript in tsconfig.json file ("rootDir": "src") ("outDir": "build")
6.//Now manually create a src folder and index.ts file
7.//Now to easily run in package.json set scripts like ("start": "npx tsc && node build/index.js")
